The application listens to audio input through a microphone, processes it in chunks, and transcribes the speech into text in real time. The transcriptions are displayed and also saved to a log file for later use.

was playing a youtube video for audio, sure the output is not faster as the application runs on a cpu but I’m 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝘆 with the results it has delivered.
